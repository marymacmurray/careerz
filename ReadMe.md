Functional Requirements
* Be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and use React as my front-end framework.
* Use Axios to consume data from an external source, and render that data via multiple components using react, passing state as props and resetting props.
* Use Z layout and flexbox.
* Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).
* Host on Surge.

Procedural Requirements
* Create a develop branch to work off of, commit to it and new major version to master once per day or after each component is working.
* Have a well-developed README.md file explaining technologies used, approaches taken, a link to my live site, relevant instructions for viewers, and any unsolved problems.
